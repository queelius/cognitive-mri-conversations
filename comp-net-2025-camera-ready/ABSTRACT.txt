Through a single-user case study of 449 ChatGPT conversations, we introduce a cognitive MRI applying network analysis to reveal thought topology hidden in linear conversation logs. We construct semantic similarity networks with user-weighted embeddings to identify knowledge communities and bridge conversations that enable cross-domain flow. Our analysis reveals heterogeneous topology: theoretical domains exhibit hub-and-spoke structures while practical domains show tree-like hierarchies. We identify three distinct bridge types that facilitate knowledge integration across communities.
