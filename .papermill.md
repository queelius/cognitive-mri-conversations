thesis:
  claim: "Personal knowledge exploration through conversational AI self-organizes into stable thematic communities early, then densifies within and between them — a growth pattern that mirrors collective knowledge systems (citation networks, scientific collaboration) but at the individual scale, suggesting that single-person AI-assisted inquiry follows the same organizational principles as distributed multi-agent knowledge creation."
  novelty: "Temporal network evolution analysis of AI conversations over 29 months; discovery of super-linear densification (γ=1.405) and sub-linear preferential attachment (β=0.763); community lifecycle tracking; bridge formation dynamics; scale-bridging parallel between individual and collective knowledge network dynamics."
  refined: "Same macroscopic growth laws (densification, preferential attachment, community stabilization) emerge at individual scale as in collective knowledge systems, but via a different mechanism (progressive revelation of latent semantic structure vs active tie formation)."

## Notes

Refreshed by papermill on 2026-02-24.

### Context

Conference paper published in Springer proceedings for Complex Networks 2025. Now extending for PLOS Complex Systems special issue (Submission ID: 41). Requirements:
- 30%+ new original material beyond conference proceedings
- Conference paper must be cited
- Must clearly state novelty vs conference paper
- iThenticate similarity must stay below 30%

### Current State

**Analysis complete, paper not yet written.**

- Conference paper (`comp-net-2025-camera-ready/paper/paper.tex`) is the published baseline
- Temporal analysis pipeline complete (6 modules in `comp-net-2025-journal/code/temporal_*.py`)
- All 7 publication-quality figures generated in `comp-net-2025-journal/paper/figures/temporal/`
- All intermediate data cached in `comp-net-2025-journal/data/temporal/`
- Full pipeline runs in 38s: `cd comp-net-2025-journal/code && python run_temporal_analysis.py`

### Key Findings

| Finding | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Densification exponent | α=1.405 (super-linear, R²=0.993) |
| Preferential attachment | α=0.763 (sub-linear, R²=0.914) |
| Community lifecycles | 35 unique, 196 continuations |
| Modularity stabilization | ~0.75 by mid-2023 |
| Bridge emergence | 5 tracked from creation |

### Next Steps

1. Set up PLOS Complex Systems LaTeX template
2. Literature survey for temporal network references
3. Write paper sections (intro, methods, results, discussion)
4. Ensure 30%+ new material, <30% iThenticate similarity
5. Co-author review
