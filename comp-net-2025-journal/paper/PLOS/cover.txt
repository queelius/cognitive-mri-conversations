Dear Editors,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, "Temporal evolution of cognitive
knowledge networks in AI-assisted conversations," for consideration as a
Research Article in PLOS Complex Systems, for the Complex Networks 2025
special issue.

This paper extends our conference paper published in the Springer proceedings
of Complex Networks 2024 (Studies in Computational Intelligence, vol. 1189).
The conference paper introduced "cognitive MRI" -- a methodology for
transforming a personal archive of ChatGPT conversations into a semantic
similarity network and analyzing its static structure. The present manuscript
adds a substantial temporal dimension (>30% new material), tracking how the
network evolves over 29 monthly snapshots spanning December 2022 through
April 2025.

WHY THIS MANUSCRIPT IS SUITABLE FOR PLOS COMPLEX SYSTEMS

The paper applies established tools from temporal network theory --
densification laws, preferential attachment, and community dynamics -- to a
novel empirical domain: a single user's AI conversation archive. We show that
this personal knowledge network exhibits evolution patterns characteristic of
much larger complex systems:

  - Super-linear densification (gamma = 1.405, R^2 = 0.993), with an exponent
    falling between patent and citation networks
  - Sub-linear preferential attachment (beta = 0.763, R^2 = 0.914), indicating
    a balanced exploration-exploitation strategy
  - Early community stabilization, with modularity reaching ~0.75 by mid-2023
    and persisting through 18 subsequent months of growth
  - Persistent bridge formation, where cross-domain connectors maintain their
    structural role once established

These results sit squarely within the scope of complex systems research:
they demonstrate universal growth laws operating in a new setting and raise
questions about scale-invariance in knowledge exploration dynamics.

HOW THIS STUDY WILL INSPIRE THE FIELD

As conversational AI becomes ubiquitous, millions of users are generating
conversation archives that constitute externalized records of cognitive
activity. Our work demonstrates that these archives have analyzable structure
and that complex network methods can extract meaningful patterns from them.
We see three ways this can drive research forward:

  1. It introduces a new empirical system for temporal network researchers --
     personal knowledge networks -- that complements established domains like
     citation, collaboration, and social networks.

  2. The striking parallel between individual and collective knowledge
     organization (same growth laws, different mechanisms) invites theoretical
     investigation into whether common principles govern knowledge exploration
     across scales.

  3. The methodology is immediately replicable: any user can export their
     ChatGPT archive and apply our open-source pipeline to analyze their own
     knowledge network, enabling multi-user studies.

All code and derived data are publicly available at
https://github.com/queelius/chatgpt-complex-net (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.15314235).
Raw conversation content is withheld for privacy, but all embeddings, edge
lists, and temporal metrics needed for reproduction are included.

This manuscript is not under consideration at any other journal.

We confirm that all authors have reviewed and approved the manuscript and
agree to its submission.
