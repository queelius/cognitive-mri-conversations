Hi Alex,

I’m sorry I only made it through related work yesterday. My suggestions are below. Overall, so far it’s pretty good! I will try to finish the paper over the next few hours.

 

Get rid of all the dashes and the bold. They make it look like ChatGPT wrote the paper. Also, the colons.
I ran the paper through iThenticate, which they claim they will do. You get 12%, which is good. I think the requirement is that it is under 30%.
Generally don’t put a citation in the abstract.
Overall, abstract is pretty good.
Intro is not bad, although why is one list bullets and one is 1,2,3? Also, get rid of the bold.
Related work is overall really well done. I especially like the way you relate the topics to your own work. I’m not sure you need all those short section. It might be better just to combine them in to 1. However, do what you think best. Instead of “our conference paper” say “our previous work”.
 

Thanks,

John
